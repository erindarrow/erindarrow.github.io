Erin Darrow is migratory by nature and currently resides in the Pacific Northwest where she writes fantasy/speculative fiction and creative nonfiction. Wilderness and woods inspire her and she enjoys capturing nature's beauty in words. When not writing or reading an endless pile of books, she heads outside to hike, watch birds, and dabble in photography. While she loves magic and unlimited imagination, she believes there is nothing more magical in life than cuddling up with a purring cat on her lap. Erin is not actually a small bird, but she aspires to live in a cozy tree cavity someday, and if she can't sprout wings, any house in the woods will do just fine, too.
