Erin Darrow writes fantasy and science fiction inspired by nature, ecology, myths, and fairy tales. After migrating near and far, she settled in Aotearoa New Zealand. When not writing or reading an endless stack of books, she wanders the wilderness, watches birds, cuddles cats, and takes too many nature photos.
