Erin Darrow is an American kiwi who migrated from the Pacific Northwest to Aotearoa New Zealand. When not writing stories inspired by nature, fairy tales, and folklore, she can be found wandering the woods, watching birds, or sipping tea. She has been the loving mom (or foster mom) to 14 cats and dreams of someday being a little bird living in a big forest.

Her stories appear in <i>DreamForge Magazine</i> and <i>Metaphorosis Books</i> among others. She has been a first reader at <i>All Worlds Wayfarer</i> since 2024.
