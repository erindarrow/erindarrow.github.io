Erin Darrow writes fantasy and science fiction inspired by nature, fairy tales, and folklore. When not writing or reading, she can be found wandering the woods, watching birds, or sipping tea. An American Kiwi, she migrated from the Pacific Northwest to Aotearoa New Zealand and is a former mapmaker, recordkeeper, and data wrangler in earth science, ecology, and wildlife biology. She has been the loving mom (or foster mom) to 15 cats (and counting) and dreams of living in the woods like a wren.

Her stories appear in <i>DreamForge Magazine</i> and <i>Metaphorosis Books</i> among others. She has been a first reader at <i>All Worlds Wayfarer</i> since 2024 and is a member of <a href="https://specfic.nz/">SpecFicNZ</a>.
