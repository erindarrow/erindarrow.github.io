Erin Darrow writes fantasy and science fiction inspired by nature, fairy tales, and folklore. When not writing or reading, she can be found wandering the woods, watching birds, or sipping tea. An American Kiwi, she migrated from the Pacific Northwest to Aotearoa New Zealand and is a former mapmaker, recordkeeper, and data wrangler in ecology and earth science. She has been the loving mom (or foster mom) to 17 cats and dreams of living in the woods like a wren.
