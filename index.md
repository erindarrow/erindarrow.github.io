Erin Darrow writes fantasy and science fiction inspired by nature, ecology, myths, and fairy tales. After migrating across continents and oceans, living in the Pacific Northwest for ten years, she has found a nest to call home in Aotearoa New Zealand. When not writing, reading or getting lost in imagination, she wanders the woods, watches birds, cuddles cats, and takes too many nature photos.
