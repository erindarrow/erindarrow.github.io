Maggie Slater, one of my co-authors on the Hope anthology kindly interviewed myself and fellow authors to coincide with the anthology's release. Check out my interview on [her site](https://maggieslater.com/2025/08/08/three-questions-erin-darrow/). She asked thoughtful questions on writing, speculative fiction, and hope. As a bonus, she also posts some of her original fiction alongside insightful, authentic posts about the realities of writing life.

[Hope: The Thing with Feathers](https://books.metaphorosis.com/anthology/2025/hope-the-thing-with-feathers/) is a collection of speculative stories featuring feather motifs and uplifting endings. It features my eco-fantsy short story, _Echo of the Desert in the Sky_, about a mother and daughter in a possible future desert world where water is scarce and magical sunbird feather could save their home.

The Hope anthology is available in epub, paperback, or hardcover from [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hope-the-thing-with-feathers/e3d72f48d2cb8646) or [Amazon](https://a.co/d/cGH6Cff).
