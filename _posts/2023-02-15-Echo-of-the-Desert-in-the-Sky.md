I'm delighted to announce that my speculative fiction short story, _Echo of the Desert in the Sky_ featuring a mother, mirage magic, and mythical sunbirds will be published in the vernal equinox issue (14) of [All Worlds Wayfarer](https://www.allworldswayfarer.com/).

The issue will release on March 13, 2023 and is available for [pre-order on Kindle now](https://a.co/d/0O1kxLa).

My story will be available for free online on All Worlds Wayfarer&#39;s website from March 20 until April 19, 2023. I will post links when they are available. For now, I will leave you with a small taste of the tale!
