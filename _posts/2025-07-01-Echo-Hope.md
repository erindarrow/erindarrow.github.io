I'm pleased to announce _Echo of the Desert in the Sky_, my mythic sunbird eco-fantasy story of a mother and daughter, is being republished in [Hope: The Thing With Feathers](https://books.metaphorosis.com/anthology/2025/hope-the-thing-with-feathers/) anthology from [Metaphorosis Books](https://books.metaphorosis.com/).

The anthology releases 2 August 2025. You can pre-order the kindle anthology full of inspiring feathery stories [here](https://www.amazon.com/HOPE-Feathers-B-Morris-Allen-ebook/dp/B0FC3PQ44H). A little bird tells me a print version will also be available and I will share that info when it comes!
