_More Than Microscopic_, my lunarpunk cli-fi fairytale, is now out in print in [DreamForge Magazine 15](https://a.co/d/1itSqtL): Each and Other. Or read it [online now](https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/stories/show/more-than-microscopic-erin-darrow).

From the editors: "Darrow delivers lyrical prose with themes of belonging and environmental stewardship, crafting a poignant tale of hope and transformation."
