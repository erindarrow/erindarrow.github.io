My lunarpunk fairytale _More Than Microscopic_ is now out in [DreamForge Anvil 18](https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/magazines/details?id=43): Solitary Journeys, Shared Souls. Read it [online now](https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/stories/show/more-than-microscopic-erin-darrow).

Descended from mer, Pearl sows phytoplankton blooms with her magic song to heal the seas. She encounters a rewilder releasing penguins on the beach and the shell hiding her magic and heart begins to weather away.

Please support positive speculative fiction and authors like me by buying the issue directly from DreamForge [here](https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/magazines/details?id=43). Issue 18 is also available [on kindle](https://a.co/d/ejVnNjb).

This story will also appear in the print issue of DreamForge Magazine 14 coming in a couple of weeks. I will share links when they are available.
